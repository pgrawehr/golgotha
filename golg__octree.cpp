// Include our associated .h file
#include "pch.h"
#include "obj3d.h"
#include "octree.h"
#include "g1_render.h"
#include "load3d.h"

// This is the final version of our octree code.  It will allow you to take  
// a 3D model, regardless of the file format (as long as it conforms to the t3DModel struct).
// The difference from the last 2 tutorials is that we store face indices, rather
// than vertices.  Check out the top of Main.cpp for a explanation of why we chose this way.
// 
// Here is a list of the important new functions added to our g1_octree class:
//
//	//This returns the number of polygons in our entire scene
//	int GetSceneTriangleCount(t3DModel *pWorld);
//
//  // This adds the current object index to our object list
//	void AddObjectIndexToList(int index);
//
//	// This recursively creates a display list ID for every end node in the octree
//	void CreateDisplayList(g1_octree *pNode, t3DModel *pRootWorld, int displayListOffset);
//
// Since we need to know the total triangle count for each node that we will
// be potentially splitting, GetSceneTriangleCount() was created to go through
// all of the objects in the model and add up their triangles to a total number.
// This number is then returned and used for the root node to pass in.
//
// Instead of going through every object in the model's object list when drawing
// each end node, we store a list of indices into the object list that are in the end node.  
// This way we don't do unnecessary looping if the triangles in that end node aren't in 
// those objects.  The AddObjectIndexToList() function adds the passed in index to our 
// index list, if it's not already there.
//
// To get a greater efficiency out of the drawing of our octree, display lists are used.
// CreateDisplayList() recursively goes through each node and creates a display list ID for each.
// This is only done once, then we can use the display ID to render that end node liquid fast.
//
// Keep in mind, that we do NOT split the triangles over the node's planes.  Instead, we
// are just storing the face indices for each object. You might wonder how this works, since 
// our t3DModel structure has multiple objects, with multiple face index arrays.  Simple,
// we just create a pointer to a t3DModel structure for every end node (m_pWorld).  Then,
// we only store the objects that are in that end node.  Of course, there is no need to
// store anything but the face indices, number of faces and objects.  We will then use
// the face indices stored in our m_pWorld pointer to pass into the original world model's
// structure to draw it.  Remember, we don't store all the objects from the original
// model's structure, just the ones that are in our node's dimensions.
//
// There is so much that is going on in this tutorial, that I suggest having a second
// window open to look at the Octree2 project, so you can contrast between what is changed
// and what isn't.  This was necessary even for me when creating this tutorial.  Also,
// I think this helps you to understand the new code if you understand what the simplified
// octree code was doing.  Follow along each function with the old code and the new code.
// The same concepts are being coded, but with full world data, not just vertices.

			// indices that MUST be an unsigned int, which gives the indices into
			// the vertex array.  That means that we can send the vertices to the video
			// card with one call to glDrawElements().  There are a bunch of other
			// functions for vertex arrays that do different things, but I am just going
			// to mention this one.  Since texture coordinates, normals and colors are also
			// associated with vertices, we are able to point OpenGL to these arrays before
			// we draw the geometry.  It uses the same indices that we pass to glDrawElements()
			// for each of these arrays.  Below, we point OpenGL to our texture coordinates,
			// vertex and normal arrays.  This is done with calls to glTexCoordPointer(), 
			// glVertexPointer() and glNormalPointer().
			//
			// Before using any of these functions, we need to enable their states.  This is
			// done with glEnableClientState().  You just pass in the ID of the type of array 
			// you are wanting OpenGL to look for.  If you don't have data in those arrays,
			// the program will most likely crash.
			//
			// If you don't want to use vertex arrays, you can just render the world like normal.
			// That is why I saved the pFace information, as well as the pIndices info.  This
			// way you can use what ever method you are comfortable with.  I tried both, and
			// by FAR the vertex arrays are incredibly faster.  You decide :)

				// Turn on the texture coordinate state

				// Point OpenGL to our texture coordinate array.

				glTexCoordPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, pRootObject->pTexVerts);
			}

			// Make sure we have vertices to render

				// Turn on the vertex array state

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// Holy cow!  That was a ton of technical garbage to sift through.  This is probably
// one of the LEAST intuitive tutorials that I have created, but hey, there is a lot
// to creating octrees.  The basics are easy to understand, but implementing it with
// a model structure can be tricky to do.  If you find any blaring errors or obvious
// notable optimizations to this code, please let me know.  It's 4am as I am finishing
// this, so I could have left out something important :)  Let's go over a brief overview
// of what was changed.
//
// The most important thing that was change in this tutorial was that we stored face
// indices instead of vertices.  In order to do this, we had to create a helper structure
// called tFaceList to partition the nodes in CreateNode().  We also created a instance
// of the t3DModel structure in our octree class.  This holds the face indices for
// each object that is in the end node.  Only the end nodes allocate an instance of
// this structure, and they do not store any other information besides the face indices.
// The rest of the data is ignored because it will be referenced from the original object
// when being drawn in CreateDisplayList().  Since we are using vertex arrays, we use the
// pIndices array of face indices to draw the world, verses the pFaces array.  If you
// don't want to use vertex arrays, go to the end AssignTrianglesToNode() and don't free
// this array, and forget about allocating the pIndices array.
//
// To create the display lists, after the octree has been creating, we just make a call
// to CreateDisplayList(), which recursively goes through all the end nodes and assigns
// then to a display list ID.  This way we can just call a list ID to draw an end node,
// and not have any loops.  This increases our frame rate drastically, especially accompanied
// with vertex arrays.  
//
// I hope this tutorial doesn't take such a huge leap from the previous that it doesn't
// offer much help.  Let me know if you have any questions, I would love to make anything
// clearer.  Please call me on things.  When creating this much code, I am bound to say
// something wrong or not explain something enough.  
//
// Good luck!
